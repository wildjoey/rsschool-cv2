### Summary
I work as a backend developer and want to improve my frontend knowledge to interact more consciously with the frontend developers on my team. Maybe someday I will retrain as a full-stack developer

### Skills
Now it is Java, but before that I had quite a lot of experience in C/C++ embedded development

### Code examples
```Java
@Configuration
public class LifeconnectAnalyzerConfigJMS {
    @Bean
    public MessageConverter jacksonJmsMessageConverter(){
        MappingJackson2MessageConverter converter =  
                new MappingJackson2MessageConverter();
        
        converter.setTargetType(MessageType.TEXT);        
        converter.setTypeIdPropertyName("_class_");
        return converter;
    }
}
```
